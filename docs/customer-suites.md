# Customer-owned hosted suites

Git-friendly `aw-suite/1` files let you define hosted semantic cases without
editing AugmentWorks source. Local `suite validate` / `suite preview` never
quote, never execute a target, and never call an LLM. A hosted
`test --suite` pins an immutable server revision, then uses the existing
quote / `--max-credits` / `--yes` consent path.

The command exists in this `0.3.7` package. Native hosted
`aw-customer-suite/1` upload translation is source on this revision and is
not in immutable registry `0.3.6`. From this clone after `npm ci` and
`npm run build`, use `node dist/index.js`. A protected `v0.3.7` publish must
complete before automation pins adopt this tarball. Do not assume existing
registry `0.3.6` contains the upload translation.

## Commands

```bash
node dist/index.js suite validate examples/customer-suites/faq-non-commerce.yaml
node dist/index.js suite preview examples/customer-suites/returns-14-day.yaml
node dist/index.js suite preview examples/customer-suites/faq-non-commerce.yaml --json
node dist/index.js schema --kind customer-suite
node dist/index.js test --suite examples/customer-suites/faq-non-commerce.yaml --estimate
node dist/index.js test --suite examples/customer-suites/faq-non-commerce.yaml --max-credits 30 --yes
```

`--estimate` creates a suite revision and requests a quote. It does not
create a run, reserve credits, or execute a target. Local preview counts are
not an authoritative price.

Both `--estimate --suite` and `test --suite` require an authorized **user
connector grant** (`AUGMENTWORKS_TOKEN`; optional
`AUGMENTWORKS_REFRESH_TOKEN`). Unset `AUGMENTWORKS_API_KEY` when choosing that
credential. Machine API keys deliberately cannot create suites: they fail
before upload with `SUITE_WRITE_REQUIRES_USER`. Use an already saved immutable
revision through an assessment's `selection.suite_revision_id` or an exact
compiled manifest for machine execution. Do not grant `suite:write` to a
machine key as a workaround. Saved-suite v2 is also unreleased source until
its publication gate is completed.

The CLI translates authoring data into the server's native
`aw-customer-suite/1` source document. Local preview `content_hash` remains
the authoring identity used to detect changed files. Hosted
`suite_content_hash` is the separate native canonical hash verified against
the server response. Scenario IDs become
`aw-customer-suite/1.0.0/<case_id>`; criterion IDs are unchanged. No source
file is relabeled and no live-target permission is implied by this adapter.

Noninteractive admission still requires a finite `--max-credits` ceiling.
`--yes` is not an unlimited budget. The CLI does not prompt, open a browser,
or raise limits silently.

## Authoring format

YAML or JSON. Snake_case keys (`schema_version`, `suite_id`, `case_id`) are
rewritten to the camelCase canonical document (`schemaVersion: aw-suite/1`).
Unsupported schema versions, duplicate case IDs, missing references,
credential-like keys, executable scripts, and `history_array_v1` fail
**before** any network call.

Local authoring limits: 64 KiB suite file, 64 KiB / 16 references,
20 cases, 20 turns, 3 repetitions, 16 criteria/tags/facts/observations.

Hosted source is additionally validated against the pinned producer schema
before upload: at most 3 turns per case, 12 facts/conditions, 2,000-character
descriptions/statements, 1,000-character facts/conditions, and 160-character
case IDs. Values are rejected, never silently truncated.

Offline authoring preview recognizes `policy.window_days` and
`policy.permitted_refusal`, but the current hosted data-only customer-suite
producer does **not** execute deterministic observations. Such suites fail
with `SUITE_HOSTED_OBSERVATION_UNSUPPORTED` before upload. Keep deterministic
checks in the existing local packet path; author supported response-only
semantic criteria for this hosted path.

Conversation capability is **not** inferred from a multi-turn case. Hosted
`multi_turn` is advertised only when `augmentworks.yaml` declares
`target.conversation.strategy: explicit_session_v1` (see the C05 session
mode). A multi-turn suite against a single-turn connector fails with
`CONVERSATION_CAPABILITY_INCOMPATIBLE` before authenticate or quote.

## Samples

| File | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `examples/customer-suites/faq-non-commerce.yaml` | Five synthetic FAQ cases (status page, hours, password reset, data export, accessibility). No commerce or return-window facts. |
| `examples/customer-suites/returns-14-day.yaml` | Offline authoring/preview example including multi-turn and deterministic observations. The current hosted producer rejects its observations; it is not a hosted acceptance fixture. |

Packed installs include the same files under `assets/customer-suites/`.

## Local versus hosted

| Capability | Local `test --local --packet` | Hosted `test --suite` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format | `aw-packet/0.1` JSON | `aw-suite/1` YAML/JSON |
| Offline validate/preview | Packet parse only | `suite validate` / `suite preview` |
| LLM rubric / hybrid | Rejected (`UNSUPPORTED_LOCAL_GRADER`) | Quoted hosted judging |
| Customer-owned cases | Private deterministic packet | Immutable suite revision |
| Quote / `--max-credits` | Not used | Required for admission |
| File change after quote | N/A | `SUITE_CHANGED_AFTER_QUOTE`; the CLI will not re-pin mutable content |
| Multi-turn | Packet `required_capabilities.multi_turn` | Config `explicit_session_v1`, not the suite file |

`--suite` cannot be combined with `--local`, `--assessment`, or `--packet`.

## Migrating from a private local packet

1. Keep the existing packet for account-free `test --local`.
2. Author an `aw-suite/1` file for hosted semantic cases (inputs, expected
   facts, references, required/advisory criteria).
3. Validate and preview offline.
4. Run hosted `test --suite` against the same connector YAML, with a finite
   `--max-credits` ceiling.
5. Do not paste judging credentials into the suite file. Do not expand to a
   hundred default scenarios. Do not import production transcripts.

Case order is file order for `test --suite`. Larger owned suites use the
server compiler:

```bash
node dist/index.js catalog list --json
node dist/index.js selection compile \
  -c augmentworks.yaml \
  --assessment ./augmentworks.assessment.yaml \
  --out ./suite-selection.manifest.json
node dist/index.js test \
  --manifest ./suite-selection.manifest.json \
  --shard shard-000 \
  --max-credits 30 \
  --yes
node dist/index.js gate --manifest-file ./suite-selection.manifest.json --declared-shards ./suite-selection.declared-shards.json --json
```

Optional assessment YAML `selection` fields (`profile: smoke|release`,
`suite_version`, tags, `include_catalog`, requested/excluded case ids) are
compiled by the server. Local `test --local` still uses deterministic packets
only. Catalog counts are not a quote. `--all-shards` requires a finite
aggregate `--max-credits` and stops before exceeding consent. Resume an
unfinished multi-shard attempt with `--execution-id`; omit it after the
attempt is terminal to start a new rerun. An incomplete declared shard set
cannot make a whole-suite gate green. `gate --manifest-file`
requires `--declared-shards` covering every expected shard, POSTs identity
only, and exits 0 only for `aw-manifest-release-policy/2` with
`evidenceSource: server` and exact coverage.
