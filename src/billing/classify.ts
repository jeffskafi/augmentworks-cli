/**
 * One explicit classification for a successfully parsed billing status.
 *
 * `observation: "succeeded"` means the HTTP query parsed. That is not a
 * release pass. `run status --json` keeps `ok: true` for observation so
 * operators can inspect an unfinished run; `exit_code` and `assessment`
 * are the gate. `run wait` continues while `waitTerminal` is false.
 *
 * Combinations (execution × evaluation × outcome → wait / assessment / exit):
 *
 * | execution | evaluation | outcome | wait | assessment | exit |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | queued/connected/running/cancel_requested | absent | null | continue | incomplete | 11 |
 * | running | absent | 0/N attempts, null | continue | incomplete | 11 |
 * | completed | absent | passed | terminal | passed (deterministic-only, known coverage) | 0 |
 * | completed | absent | failed/inconclusive/error | terminal | failed | 10 |
 * | completed | absent | null/unknown | terminal | incomplete/unknown | 11 |
 * | completed | pending/partial | any | continue | incomplete | 11 |
 * | completed | complete | passed | terminal | passed | 0 |
 * | completed | complete | failed/inconclusive/error | terminal | failed | 10 |
 * | completed | complete | null/unknown | terminal | incomplete/unknown | 11 |
 * | completed | error | any | terminal | evaluator_error | 12 |
 * | completed | unsupported | any | terminal | unsupported | 11 |
 * | failed | not pending/partial | any | terminal | failed | 10 |
 * | cancelled | not pending/partial | any | terminal | interrupted | 130 |
 * | failed/cancelled | error | any | terminal | evaluator_error | 12 |
 * | unknown | not pending/partial | any | terminal | unknown | 11 |
 *
 * Ambiguous contract combinations never silently pass. Evaluation `error`
 * takes precedence over execution failure so exit 12 stays distinct from 10.
 * Exit 0 additionally requires known reconciled coverage when progress is present.
